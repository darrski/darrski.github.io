			"Release": "August 19, 2022",
			"Notes": "Important update. I noticed a flaw in the new API logic that would have made it difficult to add the next month's flavor before the month begins. This update should accommodate that scenario, gracefully, going forward."

			"Release": "August 18, 2022",
			"Notes": "RoutineHub's uptime has become a bit unreliable, so the Shortcut has been updated so that it checks for new versions from Github. I'll continue to maintain RoutineHub, as well, and may move the version checker function back to RoutineHub if performance improves."

			"Release": "August 17, 2022",
			"Notes": "My previous method of getting the Flavor of the Day, via Google Calendar HTML, failed me. A new Github page has been configured, and the Flavor of the Day is now sourced from a REST API on that page."
